📱 SMS Spam Detector

A React + TypeScript web application that detects SMS spam using machine learning models (Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines).
The app provides an interactive UI, real-time predictions, and showcases model performance metrics.

🚀 Features

🔍 Detect spam vs. non-spam SMS messages

🤖 Multiple ML models: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM

📊 Performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

🎨 Modern UI with TailwindCSS and Lucide icons

⚡ Built with Vite + React + TypeScript
